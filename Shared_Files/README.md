# What is here?

These files represent shared assets used in this assemblage of R scripts.

Any files here that originally used data exported from Emsi have been changed to fake (random number replacement) data with correct column names only. Column names were accurate as of release data release 2019.3

Our list of representative companies has been replaced with a list of scientists from Wikipedia.

# List of Files

"ClusterLinkage.xlsx"

  - assembled from related clusters presented at www.clustermapping.us

"Emsi-NAICS-to-Porter-Cluster.xlsx"

  - a crosswalk from Emsi NAICS system
  (Slightly modified from the NAICS schema to Porter Cluster Definitions)


"Large.Region-by-subcluster-final-2019.3-2019-12-04.csv"

"Large.Region-cluster-final-2019.3-2019-12-04.csv"

"Medium.Region-by-subcluster-final-2019.3-2019-12-04.csv"

"Medium.Region-cluster-final-2019.3-2019-12-04.csv"

"Small.Region-by-subcluster-final-2019.3-2019-12-04.csv

"Small.Region-cluster-final-2019.3-2019-12-04.csv"

"total_jobs.csv"

  - files produced by "make_cluster_subcluster_tables_from_emsi_industry_table.R"
  see file for documentation

"lists_of_clusters.xlsx"

  - a list of clusters divided by kind; our local "priority" for learning,
 "traded" and "all" (traded + local) present in our region

"NAICS_crosswalks_to_Cluster_system.xlsx"

  - A standard NAICS to Porter Cluster that may also include some other custom NAICS (non standard) crosswalk. Published resources from the U.S. Cluster Mapping project were available at the time in 2012 NAICS, but our non-Emsi sources were a mix of 2012 and 2017 NAICS


"representative-companies.xlsx"

 - an example file that used to hold the names and locations of companies that were "representative" of activities in a particular industry in our Medium Region. Now it just has placeholder data (A list of scientists from Wikipedia)


other files are copies of things produced as outputs from some of the scripts that assemble data into usable bunches.
Most XLSX files include details on their origin or purpose in a sheet within.
