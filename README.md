# NoCo REDI Industry Cluster Project Code Assets

Each folder contains a set of R scripts that either process data or use that data in a ShinyApp. Please see the repo wiki for a more general description and details about the motivation for sharing these scripts. Some scripts are packaged with fake (randomly generated) data to help get started. Some of these represent generic versions of what we actually employed. This is not meant to be an exact representation of tools used in our process, but a source for building blocks to adapt our process to another place/group/etc.

## Getting Started

Using these scripts requires having Rstudio installed on your machine. All scripts can be run within the Rstudio IDE. You may need to install the libraries needed. Please see the repo wiki for help getting started with R, Rstudio, Tidyverse and Shiny. Individual code files are extensively commented with instructions for use.
