As part of this and related efforts, NoCo REDI needed to have some graphics that were in the public domain and thus could be widely shared. This page simply documents them, but also shows our "nested regional framework" and provides a visual representation of the regional "geography of jobs".

This shows the three nested regions we considered in this project/process. The blue highlight represents the "5 county" region that captures a large portion of our regional labor exchange. Image is released as CC0.

This map represents each job in Northern Colorado, Boulder MSA and Denver MSA as a dot. Region label points are at employment-weighted center of the named geography.
