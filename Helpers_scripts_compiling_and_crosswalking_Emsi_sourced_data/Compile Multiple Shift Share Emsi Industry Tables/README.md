# combine_multiple_shift_share_tables.R

This is an R script for combining specifically formated Industry Tables for a single geography downloaded from Emsi (Economicmodeling.com) for use in the NoCo REDI Cluster Alignment project 2019.


It is packaged with empty example files to illustrate column names expected. Data has been removed to comply with Emsi EULA.

It expects the default column names in a CSV industry table for the fields specified as of 2019.


There is no expectation that this will ever be updated.
